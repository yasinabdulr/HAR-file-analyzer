# harfileanalysis
Python program to analyze HAR files (network tab exports) and calculate the number of events for each user_id.
Helps the data analyst to debug events being sent by gtag (Google analytics 4), by producing an aggregate count of all events in the export. 

This can be used to compare against GA4 reports to check how many events were sent, against how many were recieved.
